This project’s goal is to create a web application to help PAST&E’s staff keep track of their volunteers’ schedules, and to help facilitate communication. This was created using a Drupal 7 installation as well as several additional modules and custom code.\r\n\r\nInstallation instructions are available [_**here**_](https://github.com/psu-capstone-aperture/aperture-docs/blob/master/Migration_Document.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\nA user guide can be found [_**here**_](https://github.com/psu-capstone-aperture/aperture-docs/blob/master/user-guide.pdf?raw=true).\r\n\r\n###Vman can:\r\n* Allow potential volunteers to apply for new accounts.\r\n* Group volunteers and staff by the age groups they will be working with.\r\n* Let administrators and staff send messages to each other and to volunteers.\r\n* Let volunteers enter their schedule into a central calendar so that the administrators and staff can easily keep track of who is working when and with which group.\r\n* Let administrators and staff update calendar entries to update or remove a volunteer’s schedule as needed.\r\n* Run reports to see who's volunteered, and for how many hours.\r\n\r\n###Team Members:\r\n* Joseph Woodruff\r\n* Evan Belt\r\n* Ruvim Micsanschi\r\n* Dan Sweet\r\n* Yuxin Gao\r\n* Minh Pham\r\n* Jon Trent","tagline":"Volunteer Management System","note":"Don't delete this file!
